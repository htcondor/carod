To build the installation packages, run:
make

This should create RPMs in RPMS/<arch> called condor-low-latency,
condor-job-hooks, and condor-job-hooks-common.   Install these RPMs.

Condor (>= 7.0.2-4) will need to be configured in order to use these job
hooks (ie the low-latency feature).  To configure condor, add the following
lines to your condor_config (default /etc/condor/) file:

# Startd hooks
LOW_LATENCY_HOOK_FETCH_WORK = $(LIBEXEC)/hooks/hook_fetch_work.py
LOW_LATENCY_HOOK_REPLY_FETCH = $(LIBEXEC)/hooks/hook_reply_fetch.py

# Starter hooks
LOW_LATENCY_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB = $(LIBEXEC)/hooks/hook_prepare_job.py
LOW_LATENCY_HOOK_UPDATE_JOB_INFO = $(LIBEXEC)/hooks/hook_update_job_status.py
LOW_LATENCY_HOOK_JOB_EXIT = $(LIBEXEC)/hooks/hook_job_exit.py

SLOT1_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD = LOW_LATENCY
STARTD_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD = LOW_LATENCY
STARTER_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD = LOW_LATENCY

FetchWorkDelay = 10 * (Activity == "Idle")
STARTER_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 30

For more information on Condor/Grid hooks please see:

The AMQP translation daemon (carod) is configured by editing the config file
/etc/opt/grid/carod.conf.  This file controls which AMQP broker
to talk to and all relevant options (exchange name, queue, ip, etc), as well 
as the configuration information for caro itself.

The Condor job hooks are configured by editing the config file
/etc/opt/grid/job-hooks.conf.  This file tells the job hooks on what port
and IP the translation daemon can be contact.  The ip and port information
in this file must match what carod is configured with.

The carod daemon can be started and stopped via the init file:
/etc/init.d/condor-low-latency

To use the low-latency feature, configure condor as mention aboved, ensure
qpid is running, and start carod.  To submit jobs, send AMQP messages to the
AMQP queue defined in the /etc/opt/grid/carod.conf configuration file, with
the classad information stored as headers in the application_headers field.
