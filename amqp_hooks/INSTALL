To install caro, run the install script as the root user:
  ./install

Once caro is installed, copy the hook_* scripts to a location that can
be accessed by condor, then configure the hooks that will be used in
the condor_config config file.

caro and the hook_* scripts are configured by editing the configuration
file /etc/opt/grid/grid_amqp.conf.  This file controls which AMQP broker
to talk to and all relevant options (exchange name, queue, ip, etc), as well 
as the configuration information for caro itself, which is needed by the
hook_* scripts to talk to the caro daemon.

Once the grid_amqp.conf is configured correctly, make sure the queue exists
in the AMQP broker and then start condor and carod.  Assuming everything is
configured correctly, condor can now process jobs from an AMQP broker.

To uninstall caro, run the uninstall script as the root user:
  ./uninstall
