To build the installation packages, run:
make

This should create RPMs in RPMS/<arch> called condor-low-latency,
condor-job-hooks, and condor-job-hooks-common.   Install these RPMs.

Condor (>= 7.0.2-4) will need to be configured in order to use these job
hooks (ie the low-latency feature).  To configure condor, add the following
lines to your condor_config (default /etc/condor/) file:

# Startd hooks
LOW_LATENCY_HOOK_FETCH_WORK = $(LIBEXEC)/hooks/hook_fetch_work.py
LOW_LATENCY_HOOK_REPLY_FETCH = $(LIBEXEC)/hooks/hook_reply_fetch.py

# Starter hooks
LOW_LATENCY_HOOK_PREPARE_JOB = $(LIBEXEC)/hooks/hook_prepare_job.py
LOW_LATENCY_HOOK_UPDATE_JOB_INFO = $(LIBEXEC)/hooks/hook_update_job_status.py
LOW_LATENCY_HOOK_JOB_EXIT = $(LIBEXEC)/hooks/hook_job_exit.py

SLOT1_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD = LOW_LATENCY
STARTD_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD = LOW_LATENCY
STARTER_JOB_HOOK_KEYWORD = LOW_LATENCY

FetchWorkDelay = ifThenElse(State == "Claimed" && Activity == "Idle", 0, 10)
STARTER_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 30

The AMQP translation daemon (carod) will first look for its configuration
in condor's configuration files.  The following parameters can be placed in
a condor configuration file to configure carod:

LL_BROKER_IP:
   Type: IP Address
   Desc: The IP address of the broker that carod should talk to

LL_BROKER_PORT:
   Type: Integer
   Desc: The port on $(LL_BROKER_IP) the broker is listening to

LL_BROKER_QUEUE:
   Type: String
   Desc: The queue on the broker for condor jobs

LL_DAEMON_IP:
   Type: IP Address
   Desc: The IP address of the interface carod use for connections

LL_DAEMON_PORT:
   Type: Integer
   Desc: The port carod should use to listen for connections

LL_DAEMON_QUEUED_CONNECTIONS:
   Type: Integer
   Desc: The number of allowed outstanding connections

LL_DAEMON_LEASE_TIME:
   Type: Integer
   Desc: The maximum amount of time a job is allowed to run without providing
         an update

LL_DAEMON_LEASE_CHECK_INTERVAL:
   Type: Integer
   Desc: How often to check for lease expiration

If the configuration is not found in condor's configuration files, then
carod will look in /etc/opt/grid/carod.conf.

The Condor job hooks will first look for their configuration in condor's
configuration files.  The following parameters can be placed in a condor
configuration file to configure the job hooks:

LL_HOOKS_IP:
   Type: IP Address
   Desc: The IP address where carod is listening for connections

LL_HOOKS_PORT:
   Type: Integer
   Desc: The port carod is listening for connections


If the configuration is not found in condor's configuration files, then
the job hooks will look in /etc/opt/grid/job-hooks.conf.  The ip and port
information for the job hooks must match how carod is configured.

The carod daemon is started and stopped by Condor's master daemon.
Example parameters to add to condor's configuration files can be found at:

/usr/share/doc/condor-low-latency-1.0/ll_condor_config

To use the low-latency feature, configure condor as mention aboved, ensure
qpid is running, and start carod.  To submit jobs, send AMQP messages to the
AMQP queue defined in the /etc/opt/grid/carod.conf configuration file, with
the classad information stored as headers in the application_headers field.
